###Instructions:
Imagine you are developing a software package for MindGrub.com that requires users to enter their own passwords.  Your software requires that userâ€™s passwords meet the following criteria:

The password should be at least six characters long.
The password should contain at least on uppercase and at least one lower case letter.
The password should have at least one digit.
Write a program that verifies that a password meets these stated criteria.  The program should allow the user to enter a password and then displays a message indicating whether it is valid or not.

Extra 10 points:  Print a message that states the password will expire in # of weeks.  This # equals the amount of characters present in the final correct password.
Extra 20 points:  Store all password creation attempts in an array and print all elements of the array until a correct password is created.
